This is a example plugin for the Bukkit, as implemented in CraftBukkit, which is a Minecraft server mod.    This plugin goes over the basics to get you on your way to developing a successful plugin.  If you have any questions, pm "tips48" on the bukkit forums(forum.bukkit.org)or look for me on #bukkit or #bukkitdev , which are in irc.esper.net
